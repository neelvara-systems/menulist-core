# Answerlattice Asset Context

**Product boundary:** Governed Answer Infrastructure
**Asset-system role:** Internal input for Website Asset Operating System
**Public-product status:** Do not expose this as Answerlattice runtime

## Narrative

Answerlattice assets should show governed support knowledge moving from product surfaces, docs, FAQs, tickets, and releases into approved support answers and controlled customer-facing surfaces.

Assets must feel systemic, dark, restrained, and infrastructure-grade. Use Answerlattice's existing diagrams, status boards, proof blocks, and public website visual language as the reference system.

The official Answerlattice logo is design-final at `public/answerlattice-logo.svg`. Use that file as the canonical transparent source for Answerlattice logo UI, metadata, favicon, PWA, OpenGraph, and splash derivatives. UI components must follow the MenuList inline SVG-path pattern through `src/components/atoms/answerlatticeLogoMark/index.tsx` so the design-team geometry, colors, gradients, filters, and stroke widths are not reinterpreted. Visible website diagrams must stay vector-based through inline SVG paths and the shared logo atom, not PNGs, screenshots, or image-wrapped logo assets. Do not redraw, recolor, reshape, simplify, reinterpret the logo mark, or reintroduce the exported black canvas/frame into logo assets.

## Approved Directions

- Canonical answers taking priority over generic retrieval.
- Page-aware support context.
- Hosted help and widget surfaces.
- Review loops for missed questions and drift.
- Product-surface governance.
- Founder/operator control without support-team sprawl.

## Rejection Rules

- No restaurant, menu, ordering, QR menu, or MenuList tenant imagery.
- No helpdesk, CMS, autonomous chatbot, or generic SaaS dashboard positioning.
- No private support tickets, customer identities, tenant IDs, or internal workspace data.
- No unsupported public claim about integrations, workflows, AI autonomy, or data handling.
- No bright generic startup gradient treatment.
